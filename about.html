<p class="one">Our program is designed to make it profitable for companies to transition away from virgin plastic and start sourcing recycled. Every one ton of virgin plastic that is offset by recycled plastic saves approximately two-three tons of Co2.  
    More than 3 billion people donâ€™t have their waste collected or disposed of safely. We need to accelerate the development of recycling infrastructure by creating markets for the waste. 
    We are building a future free from plastic pollution and poverty. Join us</p>
